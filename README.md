<h2> :book:Introduction</h2>
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data

 <h2> :book:Problem Statements</h2>

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!

 <h2> :book:Conclusion</h2>

2)adr is slightly correlated with total_of_special_requests,
